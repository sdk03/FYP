# Leveraging Large Language Models for Automated Digital Forensic Analysis

This repository contains the implementation code for my MSc Computer Science research project, which explores the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for:
- SMS data categorization (Component A)
- Forensic chat summarization (Component B)

## üîç Project Overview

The project is divided into two core components:
- **Component A:** A plugin for Autopsy that categorizes SMS data using LLMs.
- **Component B:** A Flask-based web UI that summarizes extracted chat logs.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| autopsy_plugin | Component A; SMS categorization plugin for Autopsy |
| summarisation_ui | Component B; Local LLM-based chat summarization interfaces |
| data_samples | Sample datasets and test data |
| evaluation_tools | Scripts for evaluating categorization and summarization accuracy |

## üõ† Installation

Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Digital-Forensics-LLM-Integration.git
cd Digital-Forensics-LLM-Integration
pip install -r requirements.txt
